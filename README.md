# Welcome & Introduction

## Purpose
This documentation is intended for both researchers and bioinformaticians and comprehensively describes the Bioinformatics Shared Resource (BISR). Our goal at the BISR is to enable data-drive insights with quick turnaround times. For researchers we highly recommend and ask you to carefully read our `For Research Collaborators` section. For bioinformaticians the `For Bioinformatics Pipelines` sections will be most relevant and non-BISR bioinformaticians are welcome to utilize our pipelines. Lastly, the `For BISR Logistics` section is for internal matters specific to VCU operations.

## Synopsis of the "For Research Collaborators" Section
As users of the BISR, we want you to understand what we can deliver and the requirements/expectations we have in order to generate speedy and accurate results. In order to understand these requirements we have the following subsections:
- [Collaborating with Us](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/Collaborating-with-Us) - Description of our expectations, our BISR workflow, and frequently asked questions
- [Preparing a Samplesheet](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/Preparing-a-Samplesheet) - Instructions for the generation of a samplesheet (where applicable)
- [Overview of the RNA-seq Pipeline](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/Overview-of-the-RNA%E2%80%90seq-Pipeline) - High-level overview of our RNA-seq pipeline with a manuscript ready paragraph
- [Common Downstream Analyses](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/Common-Downstream-Analyses) - Description of common downstream analyses we perform following our automated pipeline analyses
- [Specialized/Custom Work](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/Specialized-Custom-Work) - Explanation of specialized work that is currently outside of our automated pipelines/immediate expertise
<!-- [Overview of the Peak Calling Pipeline](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/Peak-Calling-Overview) - High-level overview of our Peak Calling pipeline with a manuscript ready paragraph-->
<!-- [Overview of the scRNA-seq Pipeline](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/scRNA‐seq-Overview) - High-level overview of our Peak Calling pipeline with a manuscript ready paragraph-->


## Synopsis of the "For Bioinformatics Pipelines" Section
To generate consistent and quick results we have setup several community developed pipelines from [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). In addition, we have implemented custom pipelines where required. This section includes step-by-step guides for all of these pipelines and contributes to the overall transparency of our code base. Briefly, the corresponding subsections include:
- [The Bioinformatics Rundown](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/The-Bioinformatics-Rundown) - Introduction of bioinformatics resources used by the BISR
- [Technical & nextflow Overview](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/Technical-&-nextflow-Overview) - Description of nextflow and its use within the VCU servers
- [RNA-seq Step-by-Step Guide](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/RNA-seq-Step-by-Step-Guide) - Detailed usage guide for RNA-seq data
- [Developing a New Core Pipeline](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/Developing-a-New-Core-Pipeline) - Explaining the process of introducing new pipeline into the BISR workflow
- [Pushing Custom Code to Github For Publications](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/Pushing-Custom-Code-to-Github-for-Publications) - Explaining how to upload publication ready code
<!--- [Peak Calling Step-by-Step Guide](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/Peak-Calling-Step-by-Step-Guide) - Detailed usage guide for data that requires peak analysis (i.e. ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, etc)-->
<!--- [scRNA-seq Step-by-Step Guide](https://github.com/VCU-Bioinformatics-Core/bioinformatics-epicenter-pipelines/wiki/scRNA-seq-Step-by-Step-Guide) - Detailed usage guide for scRNA-seq data-->
